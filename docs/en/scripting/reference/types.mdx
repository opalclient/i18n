# Shared Types

These types are used throughout the scripting API as parameters and return values. Each one is a script-safe wrapper that exposes stable method names — **do not access `.x` / `.y` fields directly**, as those are remapped to intermediary names at runtime.

## BlockPos

**Global constructor:** `new BlockPos(x, y, z)`

Represents a block coordinate. Returned by `player.getBlockPosition()` and world query methods. Can also be constructed by scripts.

<Method
    name="getX"
    signature="int getX()"
    description="Returns the X coordinate."
    returns={{ type: "int", desc: "X coordinate." }}
/>

<Method
    name="getY"
    signature="int getY()"
    description="Returns the Y coordinate."
    returns={{ type: "int", desc: "Y coordinate." }}
/>

<Method
    name="getZ"
    signature="int getZ()"
    description="Returns the Z coordinate."
    returns={{ type: "int", desc: "Z coordinate." }}
/>

<Method
    name="offset"
    signature="BlockPos offset(Direction direction)"
    description="Returns a new BlockPos offset by one block in the given direction."
    params={[
        { name: "direction", type: "Direction", desc: "The direction to offset toward." }
    ]}
    returns={{ type: "BlockPos", desc: "The offset position." }}
    example="const below = pos.offset(side.getOpposite());"
/>

## Vec2f

**Global constructor:** `new Vec2f(yaw, pitch)`

Represents a yaw/pitch rotation pair in degrees. Returned by all `rotation.*` methods. Can also be constructed by scripts to pass as a priority rotation.

<Method
    name="getYaw"
    signature="float getYaw()"
    description="Returns the yaw (horizontal rotation) in degrees."
    returns={{ type: "float", desc: "Yaw in degrees." }}
/>

<Method
    name="getPitch"
    signature="float getPitch()"
    description="Returns the pitch (vertical rotation) in degrees."
    returns={{ type: "float", desc: "Pitch in degrees." }}
    example={`const rot = rotation.getRotation();\nrotation.set(rot.getYaw(), rot.getPitch());`}
/>

---

## Direction

**No constructor** — instances are received from `world.getAdjacentDirections(pos)`. Represents one of the six cardinal block faces.

<Method
    name="getOpposite"
    signature="Direction getOpposite()"
    description="Returns the direction directly opposite (e.g. NORTH → SOUTH, UP → DOWN)."
    returns={{ type: "Direction", desc: "The opposite direction." }}
/>

<Method
    name="getName"
    signature="String getName()"
    description="Returns the lowercase name of the direction."
    returns={{ type: "String", desc: "e.g. \"north\", \"up\"." }}
    example={`const sides = world.getAdjacentDirections(pos);\nconst side = sides.get(0);\nclient.print(side.getName()); // "north"`}
/>
